# Minecraft Data Generator Organization

Welcome to the **Minecraft Data Generator** GitHub organization.  
This organization hosts multiple repositories related to automated extraction, generation, and dumping of Minecraft game data across many versions.

The goal of this organization is to provide reproducible, versioned, and automatically generated datasets for Minecraft, created either from the official Mojang data generator or from custom tooling.

---

## Repositories

### [data_generator](https://github.com/MinecraftDataGenerator/data_generator)
Runs the **official Mojang data generator** for every available Minecraft version.  
A scheduled workflow (cron) downloads the corresponding server JAR, executes the data generator, and pushes the resulting dump to a version-specific branch.  
- **`r-<version>`** → Release versions  
- **`s-<version>`** → Snapshot versions

---

### [versapacket-fabricexport-dump](https://github.com/MinecraftDataGenerator/versapacket-fabricexport-dump)
Contains extended game-data dumps generated by a custom Fabric mod.  
These include additional details not provided by the official data generator, such as:
- Block states with bounding boxes  
- Entity data  
- Data tracker values  
- Registry IDs  
… and more.

Each branch corresponds to a specific historical Minecraft version.

---

### [versapacket-fabricexport](https://github.com/MinecraftDataGenerator/versapacket-fabricexport)
Holds the Fabric mod source code used to generate the extended dumps.  
Each branch builds sequentially on the previous version, allowing the mod to compile and run across many versions with incremental updates.  
Workflows automate fetching, building, and generating the dumps.

---

### [empty-world](https://github.com/MinecraftDataGenerator/empty-world)
A minimal Minecraft world with empty region files.  
Used to ensure that dump generators (e.g., Fabric mod tooling) run without generating new terrain or chunk data.

## Notes

**Generated dumps contain data produced by Mojang’s game and tools.
You should review and respect Mojang’s licensing terms for redistribution or usage!!!!!!**
